# tddphp
this project is to demostrate test driven development in php. I used PHPUnit. 
The project has three folders.

# Src
It contains the source files of the php class that I want to test. In this case, I have a sum clas that test summing up items in an array and add that adds up two numbers passed to it.

# tests
It contains the written test. i have demonstrated 6 asserts

# Vendor
It contains the bin and related installations of phpunit gotten from composer install. I use PHPUnit version 5 and I specified that in my composer.com

# Composer
I give requirements to install PHPUnit version and I create a PHP namespace for the src folder. 

# Phpunit.xml
defines the autoload file of phpunit.

# Testing
run the command
# $ vendor/bin/phpunit
